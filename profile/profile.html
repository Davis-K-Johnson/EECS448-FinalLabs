        <p>I'm xXx_EpicGamr_xXx and if there's one thing I like more than getting some sick Fortnite dubs,
            <br>it's chilling with the bois and mining diamonds in minecraft. I'm 21 so I totally drink beer and do
            <br>other fun adult stuff. I'm pretty awesome so I won't be accepting friend requests that aren't from
            <br>certified gamers such as myself, but if you think you're up to the task you'll have to beat me in
            <br>a 1v1 in CoD.
